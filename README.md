# Sugar Live Build
## Introduction

Welcome to Sugar Live Build! This makes a complete bootable image
containing Sugar, the Sugar toolkits, and the demonstration
activities.

- It can be booted from hard drive, flash drive, and optical media,
automatically starting Sugar without persistence;

- It can be installed as a virtual machine, with persistence and
password protection,

- It contains all build dependencies, configured source trees (git
clones in /usr/src), and binaries (make install) for Sugar modules
and the demonstration activity set.

If you're looking for a pre-built ISO file see
[Downloads](http://people.sugarlabs.org/~quozl/sugar-live-build-20171009/).

## How to build

1. Install Debian Stretch;

2. Clone this repository;

3. Run the `build` script.

This will take some time to process; at the end you will have a file
ending with `.hybrid.iso`, which is your iso-bootable file.

## How to add activities

1. Open the `build` script with your prefered text editor.

2. For each activity you want to add to your live image, add the
following line to to the `build` script in the *clone* section.
Replace the URL of the git repository with the URL of repository of
the activity you are adding and replace `ActivityName` with the name
of the activity you are adding. Be sure to use `.activity` as the
suffix.

    `clone https://github.com/username/link-to-repository.git     ActivityName.activity`
